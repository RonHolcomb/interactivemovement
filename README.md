Hi professor, for this project I created a series of webpages that link to one another and as you view them you asked the age old question. Accept or decline the page's cookies. I decided to play on this common event and have each page ask you to accept or decline different kinds of cookies. I thought that this would be a fun way to include html, css, and js in my project. I apologize that this was submitted so late, but I struggled with some internet issues from the weather, and some of the coding itself. I hope that you enjoy the pages that I made for you! -Deborah
